# Hcaktoberfest 2021

## PARTICIPATION
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, you’re welcome to participate.</p>

<p>Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/project. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a repository/project is participating in Hacktoberfest. Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer of the repository/project to count.</p>

<p>You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<li>Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
<li>If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
<li>If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
<li>To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.
<li>This year, the first 50,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

<p>A repository/project is considered to be participating in Hacktoberfest if the 'hacktoberfest' topic is present and is accepting public contributions via pull requests. An individual pull request can also be opted-in directly by adding the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.</p>

<p>A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label. A pull request with any label containing the word 'spam' or 'invalid' will be considered ineligible for Hacktoberfest.</p>

First line, no more than 50 characters

Details section, as long as you want. Not always necessary, but
available if you need it. Wrapped at 72 characters. Present imperative
tense is preferred for commits. That means "fix bug", not "fixes bug" or
"fixed bug".

- Use bullets if you need
- Bullets are a good way to summarize a few things

If you have too much info here, it might be a good candidate to break
down into multiple commits. You can use emoji here too :sparkles:
